## Motivation

Ideally people should spend 8hours for work, 8hours for sleep and 8hours for family/hobbies to make the most of 24hours and live a healthy and sustainable lifestyle.
The app allows users to live a well-balanced work-life by tracking and visualizing the user's daily activities .

## Overview

An app with a simple and “easy to access” UI is able to track the user's time spent on different categories and display the data collected in a concise and informative way by utilizing multiple statistical tools. Furthermore, the app will give a “healthy lifestyle score” to users based on their history data.

## User Story

*“Must have”:*

1. AS A user, I WANT an “user-friendly” UI to record my time into different categories (3 for now), SO THAT my daily activities are saved in the app.
2. AS A user, I WANT a reminder for me to stop time tracking, SO THAT the data collected is validated.
3. AS A user, I WANT an informative history time tracking dashboard, SO THAT all my saved time data is visualized and I can plan well for the future.
4. AS A user, I WANT to be able to track my time easily using my phone
5. AS A user, I WANT the app to remember me, my settings and my history

*“Nice to have”:*

6. AS A user, I WANT a “healthy lifestyle score”, SO THAT I can easily evaluate my past work-life balance.
7. AS A user, I WANT a score ranking among different users, SO THAT I can be motivated to live a healthier lifestyle.
8. AS A user, I WANT a dynamic recommendation based on my time usage, SO THAT I can plan better for the future and be encouraged to live a healthier lifestyle.
